# Custom Operating System

This project is a simple operating system that I built **from scratch** using **Assembly** and **C**, this work takes guidance and inspiration from:  

[*Operating Systems: Three Easy Pieces*](https://pages.cs.wisc.edu/~remzi/OSTEP/).

[*The Little Book About OS Development*](https://littleosbook.github.io/book.pdf).

The operating system uses **GRUB** as the bootloader, which is responsible for loading the kernel into memory during startup. From there, the kernel takes over execution and begins managing the system.  



## Kernel Loading and Memory Layout

At its core, the kernel is simply a program in **ELF format**. GRUB loads this program into memory at specific addresses defined by the `link.ld` linker script.  

- The kernelâ€™s code is set to begin execution at **address `0x00100000`**, as specified in the linker script.  
- Addresses below `0x00100000` are reserved for low-level functionality, such as:  
  - **Memory-mapped I/O**  
  - **Frame buffer writing** (both of which this OS utilizes).  


The first of my own assembly code to get ran is in the `loader.s` file. The entry point is called loader and its purpose is to setup the stack and jump into the kernel C code entry point `kmain`.
